// dock-flash — HOST half of a dock feature plugin.
//
// This plugin is primarily client-side: the dock workbench runs in the
// browser and all UI interaction happens through ctx.workbench. The host
// half therefore only needs minimal plumbing.
//
// Host-side responsibilities:
// - Registers the 'dock-flash' settings namespace so the client can
//   persist panel preferences (order, active skin, trigger position, etc.)
//   and alert thresholds via ctx.remote.settings.
// - Exposes HTTP routes for the client to query host-side alert queue,
//   profile inventory, the live plugin switch, and a health heartbeat.
//
// (The system proxy subsystem has been extracted into the `dsh-flash-proxy`
// plugin — proxy mode, NO_PROXY policy, testUrl, connection diagnostics,
// and the five `dsh-flash-proxy:*` QuickControl switches now live there.)
//
// This half is ESM (`"type": "module"`, and DSH's own entry is ESM too), so
// `require` does not exist here. Everything that used to be a lazy `require()`
// in a try/catch now imports statically.
